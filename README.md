Description
In this application we are using moment.js to make a day planner. The planner will be able to keep track of task that are written down on the website. It will highlight the current hour and will be highlighted. Anything past the hour will be highlighed a different hour.


Table of Contents
HTML code uses bootstrap to make the rows that consist of the time, textbox and a save button, and uses col to arrange the colums.
JS code uses moment.js to keep track of time
Use JQuery to get familiar with it just in case we run into it in the future
